# Introduction to the Heart Disease Predictor

### Overview
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each
year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of 5CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and
one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by
CVDs and this dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease.

People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk
factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and
management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

Thus, the heart disease predictor was created to be of use for early detection for possible intervention and monitoring.

The ML model uses a stacked model with a Random Forest base model, and a Logistic Regressor metamodel, to classify whether
the user is at risk for Heart Disease or not. The resulting model was then applied to a streamlit interface to allow users 
to enter their own data for real-time predictions.

The data used for the predictor was trained using the "Heart Failure Prediction Dataset" provided by user fedesoriano.
