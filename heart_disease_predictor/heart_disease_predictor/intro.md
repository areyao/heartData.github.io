# Introduction to the Heart Disease Predictor

### Overview
The following notebook chronicles the creation of the Heart Disease Predictor Streamlit app. This notebook is split into various parts: Project Objectives, Methodologies, About the Dataset, Preprocessing, Model Selection, and Streamlit Interface Creation.

### Project Objectives
Project Objectives include:
1. Dataset selection and familiarization
    
    - Familiarization with the selected dataset, understanding the features to get project decisions and directions.


2. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning, and
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Profiling

   - Clean, enhance, and explore the dataset for improved analysis and insights to ensure the data quality and the consistency. 


4. Model Selection

    - Select and optimize the most suitable classification or regression models and enhance the project solution. 


5. Model Development and Evaluation

    - Develop, evaluate, and validate model. Efficient coding practices, and effective evaluation metrics are expected. 


6. Model Interpretability and Charts Visualization

    - Enhance model interpretability and visualization through interactive charts, SHAP library, Streamlit interface, and a summary dashboard.


7. Deployment and Containerization

    - Deploy and containerize the Streamlit web app using Docker.

   
### Methodologies


### Preprocessing

### Model Selection
The ML model uses a stacked model with a Random Forest base model, and a Logistic Regressor metamodel, to classify whether
the user is at risk for Heart Disease or not. The resulting model was then applied to a streamlit interface to allow users 
to enter their own data for real-time predictions.
